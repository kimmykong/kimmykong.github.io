			<p>Hello world!  I'm Kim Phillip, and I am a rising sophomore at the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering studying computer engineering.</p>
			
			<p>I officially got my start into the tech world during my freshman year of high school in my web design class where we learned the basics of HTML and CSS.  I furthered this by taking computer programming my senior year and ended up winning an award from NCWIT for my aspirations and excellence in computing.  During my time in high school, I <a href="projects.html#laser">interned</a> at the local science museum, Discovery World, and created <a href="projects.html#rkhs">RKHS Homework</a>, a Facebook group dedicated to support students' academic success.  </p>

			<p>For college, I decided to leave my Milwaukee hometown of 18 years for New York to pursue my dreams in becoming a software engineer.  During my first year, I was introduced to the fundamentals of programming using Python and C++.  </p>

			<p>I am currently working on learning about web development, practicing solving programming problems, and developing for Android.</p>
